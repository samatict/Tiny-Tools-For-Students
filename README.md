Title: Use Excel to extract a list of courses completed on LinkedIn Learning  
Instruction: See existing data as examples. To use your own data, delete existing data from Cell A3 and below cells in Column A. Go to the Learning History sectio on LinkedIn Learning, select and copy the whole list of courses, then select Cell A3 (in Column A) and "paste special, as unicode text", to paste the copied text. After pasting, you will get a list of courses Column G. Then you can simply copy them for your use such as for editing in MS Word.  
NOTE 1: I wrote the formula only from row 3 to 2000. If your data is more than 2000 rows, please create more formula written in Column C, Column E, and Cell G3.  
NOTE 2: The date format is month/day/year (as copied from LinkedIn Learning page). For example, 6/2/2024 is June 2nd, 2024.
